# Python Programming Assignment

## Solve the following programs using Python programming language.

### Problem 1: Reverse List In-Place
Read a list of n elements. Pass this list to a function which reverses this list in-place without creating a new list.

### Problem 2: Analyze Text Input
Write a program to input line(s) of text from the user until Enter is pressed. Count the total number of characters in the text (including white spaces), total number of alphabets, total number of digits, total number of special symbols, and total number of words in the given text. (Assume that each word is separated by one space).

### Problem 3: Replace Blanks with Hyphens
Write a function that takes a sentence as an input parameter where each word in the sentence is separated by a space. The function should replace each blank with a hyphen and then return the modified sentence.

### Problem 4: Delete Character from String
Write a function `deleteChar()` which takes two parameters: a string and a character. The function should create a new string after deleting all occurrences of the character from the string and return the new string.

### Problem 5: Convert String to Title Case
Write a user-defined function to convert a string with more than one word into title case where each word's first letter is capitalized. The string is passed as a parameter.

### Problem 6: Manage Friends' Contact Information
Write a program to input your friendsâ€™ names and their Phone Numbers and store them in the dictionary as key-value pairs. Perform the following operations on the dictionary:
- a) Display the name and phone number of all your friends
- b) Add a new key-value pair in this dictionary and display the modified dictionary
- c) Delete a particular friend from the dictionary
- d) Modify the phone number of an existing friend
- e) Check if a friend is present in the dictionary or not
- f) Display the dictionary in sorted order of names.
