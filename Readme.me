## Overview

This repository is designed to help you develop a solid foundation in data analysis and problem-solving using Python. The assignments cover a range of topics, including statistical analysis, data structures, and practical applications of data analysis techniques.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Statistics - Central Tendency

This assignment focuses on understanding and calculating measures of central tendency such as mean, median, and mode.

### Assignment 2: Python User Menu Driver Codes

This assignment involves creating user-driven menu interfaces using Python, which allow users to interact with and manipulate data through a series of menu options.

### Assignment 3: List-Tuple-Dictionary Based Python Data Driven Module

In this assignment, you'll work with Python data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries to perform various data-driven tasks and operations.

### Assignment 4: Earthquake Data Analysis

This assignment involves analyzing earthquake data to extract meaningful insights and patterns. It covers data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### Assignment 5: Menu Based Jupyter Notebook

This assignment combines the skills learned in previous assignments to create a menu-based interactive Jupyter Notebook that allows users to perform various data analysis tasks.
