# Python Programming Assignment 5

**Instructor: Dr. Sachin D. Patil**

**Due Date: September 9, 2023**

## Assignment Overview

This assignment involves writing Python programs to solve various tasks including character classification, quadratic equation roots calculation, triangle type determination, arithmetic calculator, grade calculation based on marks, and date manipulation.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Character Classification
- Determine whether the character entered is in lowercase, uppercase, digit, or a special character.

### Task 2: Quadratic Equation Roots
- Find the roots of the quadratic equation.

### Task 3: Triangle Type Determination
- Given three sides, determine the type of triangle based on conditions:
  - No triangle if \( a \geq b+c \)
  - Right Angled triangle if \( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 \)
  - Obtuse triangle if \( a^2 > b^2 + c^2 \)
  - Acute triangle if \( a^2 < b^2 + c^2 \)
  - Equilateral triangle if all sides are the same
  - Isosceles triangle if two sides are the same
  - Scalene triangle otherwise

### Task 4: Menu-Driven Simple Arithmetic Calculator
- Write a menu-driven program to demonstrate a simple arithmetic calculator using conditional statements (if-else).

### Task 5: Grade Calculation Based on Marks
- Display the grade obtained by a student based on the marks using a switch-like structure:
  - Below 40 marks: Fail
  - 40-49 marks: E
  - 50-59 marks: D
  - 60-69 marks: C
  - 70-79 marks: B
  - 80-89 marks: A
  - 90-100 marks: A+

### Task 6: Date Manipulation
- Program to find the date of the next day given today's date using an else-if ladder.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
